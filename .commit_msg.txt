Robust Elite Seed + global dedup utility + daily poll stub + system-wide consistency pass

- Add src/lib/dedup.ts: single source of truth for (apn,county) fingerprinting,
  normalizeCounty, isDuplicateError, and shared PR data coercion helpers
- Upgrade top10/route.ts: per-APN audit logging, new/updated/skipped tracking,
  events dedup counting, last_enriched stamps, expanded lead dedup check
- Add daily-poll/route.ts: Vercel Cron-ready GET stub calling top10 for
  Spokane + Kootenai with CRON_SECRET auth guard
- Unify all 7 insert paths to use distressFingerprint() from dedup.ts,
  removing all inline createHash calls and local normalizeCounty duplicates
- Fix skip-trace fingerprint bug: was missing county in hash (cross-county
  collision risk), now uses standardized 4-part format
- Stamp last_enriched in ownerFlags across all enrichment paths
- Add Last Enriched timestamp to Overview tab in MasterClientFileModal
- Dashboard handleEliteSeed toast now shows new/updated/deduped breakdown
- Deep polish on CompsMap: debounced radius search, 5m cache, preferCanvas,
  marker cap, loading overlay, enhanced detail panel with distance/ppsf/distress
- ARV adjustments panel: condition slider, offer pct, rehab estimate with
  live profit projection
